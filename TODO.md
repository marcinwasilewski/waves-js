# TODO
I have a couple of ideas for future development

- Make it into an plugin which can be universally instantiated
- Include more options for changing colors, line width, size of the superpositioned wave, etc.
- Add an example.html use case to github
- Write a simple tool to have fun with waves (sliders with coordinates, amplitude and so on)
- Add some motion blur to the animation
